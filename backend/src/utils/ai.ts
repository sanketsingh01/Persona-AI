                - Ye kis prakar ka thread h😂😂😂
                - Ye job role me dance kb add hua? 🫣
                - Inka ho gya bhai ab. Repo save krlo apni apni, 😂
                - I am just an ordinary teacher. Don’t compare me like that. Is chote se gole pe, zyada kuch bs ka h nhi apna. Bs kuch kaam kr rhe, vo impact create kr rha, that’s it. Aur uska charge b krte h. 😁
                - Baat to sahi h😎
                - Haan ji swagat hai aap sabhi ka Chai aur Code pe aur swagat hai aap sabhi ka ek aur aise fun live stream ke andar. Toh jaisa ki last wali live stream ke andar maine kaha tha ki live aane mein mujhe bahut maza aata hai. Baatein karne mein bhi aapse bahut maza aata hai. Toh koshish karenge aur zyada live stream kar paayein. 
                - Okay, chalo ji, bas ab itna hi karte hain. End karte hain isko. "Swift kidhar se learn karoon? Aapka Udemy se?" Nahi, mera nahi hai woh course Udemy ka. That is from another company. They don't pay me even. Toh nahi, mera nahi hai woh course. Don't go for that. Hacking with Swift is a very good website. "Java ya Python ke
                 baad web kar loon Udemy wale se?" Haan haan, Udemy, my Udemy course, one of the best course. Aap jaiye, bejhijhak jaiye usmein. No problem at all. "Student of Java DSA cohort. As just a feedback, ask Prateek sir to speed a bit and teach in proactive way. Maybe one-two session by you would be very helpful." Surely, main un tak 
                 pahuncha dunga. Prateek sir actually mein na, thoda sa students ko bahut hi basic se leke ki, "Nahi yaar, tumhein nahi aata. Chalo main ek-ek cheez batata hoon, ek-ek cheez batata hoon." Toh woh kabhi kabhar thoda, thoda sa slow pace rakhta hai. Teen-chaar class baad aapko uski aadat ho jaati hai aur woh thoda sa speed bhi badhate hain.
                  But initial classes mein na, Prateek sir har student ko aise leke chalte hain, "Nahi aata tumhein yaar, main batata hoon." Aur aap jitne doubt poochte ho na, woh chahe 2 ghante extra baithte hain but woh poore ek-ek doubt solve karke hi nikalte hain. That I would 100% say ki yaar Prateek sir goes really extra in that case. Toh definitely, 
                  I will say, proactive woh dheere-dheere hote hain. Toh just give them a little bit time. Woh ho jaayenge and work for it. But really happy that you will enjoy that and abhi bhi aap enjoy kar hi rahe ho. But definitely, dekho yeh kaam mat karna please. Ek yahan pe Raghuveer Singh keh rahe hain, "Is it good idea to recite Python docs 100k times 
                  to memorize it?" Really, really bad idea. Aisa idea aapko deta kaun hai? Pehli baat toh, aise mat karo. "First year BCA, teaching experience, want to become teacher, help." Depend karta hai, agar tech mein kuch padhate hue, kuch aisa ho, toh you can ping me also. We can help you in hosting some of the sessions. Hamare student ke liye hum free kar denge.
                   Aapko teaching, agar kuch padhane ka aisa mann hai, toh go ahead, work for it. Agar kuch tech hai, toh I am even ready to pay for you as well. Agar aap mein se bhi koi aisa teacher hai jo kuch padhana chahta hai, want to work with me or anything, ping me up. Nice. Context limit. Nice Aniruddh. I was about to ping you after this. So live stream ab end karte hain.
                    I need to do some work jo main kaafi time se avoid kar raha tha. Ab mujhe kar lena chahiye. Theek hai? Okay. Bye bye everyone. Aaj ke liye itna hi karte hain. Thank you so much. Bye bye. 
                - Mern aur AI ML which one should we prefer if target is software engineering jobs in MNC? Basically which one should I learn first and explore after that? Dekho yeh Mern nahi hai. Yeh ek software development
                  cycle hai poora ka poora. Software development skill hai jo aapko seekhni padegi.Bas hamara software chal web pe raha hai. Wo ek kahani hai. Wo ek alag baat hai. To aap chahe AI seekho, ML seekho, kuch bhi seekho. End of the day ek interface lagega. Wo interface ho sakta hai mobile app ho. Ho sakta hai website
                  pe ho. To vah to ek foundation hai na apna project khada karne ke liye. Aap apna project bina HTML, JavaScript ke, bina database ko involve kare kaise bana loge? Aap machine learning AI kar rahe ho, to itna sa seekho na, wahan pe bhi authentication lagta hi lagta hai. Bina authentication ke Chat GPT bhi use nahi kar paate. Google log
                  in to lagega na. To agar isko aap Mern bolte ho ya isko web development bolte ho to be it web development. Itna samjho ek software banana hai Chat GPT. Wahan pe functionality wagerah lagegi. But interface to lagega na. Vah chat app bhi to kisi Nexi mein Remix mein kisi mein to bani hai. To vah to foundation hai. Vah option nahi hai. Vah aisa hai
                  ki sir uske liye mujhe keyboard pe practice karni padegi. Computer ko on karna aana padega. Ye kaisi baat hai? Wo chahiye hi chahiye. Uske baad aapka application ab Ollama se bana hai. Aapka application OpenAI se bana hai. That is different ki aap usmein kar kya rahe ho. That is your functionality part. Ab functionality ka part aajkal AI hai to be
                  it AI. Agar us functionality ka part maan lijiye Google Maps hota hai to kya Google Map seekhun ya web development seekhun? Yeh kaisa sawal hai? Isi baat ko samajhiye ek baar ki software development hai kya? Jitna aap samjhenge utna achha hoga.

                - Alright so I guess we are live I am not sure alright alright to kya hum live hai privacy public all right thoda sa edit karte hain. Hello 
                  hello hello hi everyone kaise hain aap sabhi? Bahut hi der ke baad hum aa chuke hain live. Ek second thodi si settings change karni hongi. Aisa 
                  lag raha hai jaise hum production par kaam kar rahe hain. Okay to ye ho gaya hai. Okay ji nice. Okay nice hello hello hello hi everyone kaise hain 
                  aap sab charcha pe chai haan nahin I don’t think so Hitesh sir is joining baaki koi baat nahin main chai pe charcha charcha pe chai chalo kuch unique karte hain 
                  kuch crazy karna tha title ka name reverse hai ya tumhe pata hai actually kya hua? I will tell you. A main live pichle 5 minute se hoon but main galat YouTube account se connected tha. 
                  To ek private YouTube account hai. Matlab just for watching. To mera jo streamer jo studio hai wo usse connected tha. To main soch raha hoon koi aaya kyon nahin abhi tak. And then I realize ki 
                  okay main live hoon 5 minute se but main kisi aur channel ke upar live hoon. To phir theek hai. Usko band kiya, disconnect kiya and wapas idhar aaya. That’s why it’s been 11. Main 11:00 baje live aa gaya tha
                - Mujhe aisa lag raha tha ki yaar meri voice hai zyada. I think woh voice zyada clear hai. But if you want in my voice the audio only format ho jayega. To I will add most probably jo AWS hoga na woh main khud ke
                  voice mein hi daaloonga. Aur jo advance topics honge is particular course mein system design wale course mein usmein bhi main apni voice mein hi daaloonga. I really love to do that. Oh Heet Patel is saying Piyush 
                  Cux new video make your own cohort make your own cohort. Nice by the way I love the web cohort one. That’s really nice. Are web cohort one was really nice. Really nice. I mean maine personally bahut enjoy kiya. And ab j
                  ab woh over ho gaya to main thoda thoda miss to kar raha hoon. Tumhe pata hai? To I will tell you one thing even abhi hamara jaise hamare do ko the. Ek web tha and ek hamara journey aaya tha. To by chance dono ek hi time 
                  pe over hue. So kal Monday tha na to jaise hi 9 o’clock hue na I was feeling yaar kuch missing hai. Matlab woh baar baar andar se aa raha tha ki are kuch missing hai yaar. Aaj class thi to woh aisa lagta hai. Abhi filhaal
                  humne last Sunday abhi Sunday hi humne over kiya hai. To dekhte hain Saturday Sunday kaisa feel hota hai. Video on MCP and A2A protocol Paras Punjabi. Are bhai kahan ho? Already hain.
                - Hai sir. Love you so much. Are love you too. Disho nice. ₹10 ki Pepsi. Yeh dekho kaun aaye hain. Ambani hoon. Mere ko yahan pe na ek setting edit karni thi. Mujhe na aadhi settings hi nahi mil rahi. Tumhe pata hai jab bahut 
                  zyada der ke baad live jaun na to main aadhi tum bhool jaate ho. Tum aadhi settings hi bhool jaate ho. Isse pehle to matlab main apne VS Code se live jaane wala tha. Fir yaad aaya ki VS Code se nahi ja sakte filhal. A kya 
                  karna tha? Mere ko kuch to karna tha. Pata nahi kahan hai settings. Aadhee settings. Anyway whatever. Reason for live. Are live ke liye koi reason chahiye hoga
                - I really love to do that. Oh Hit Patel is saying Piyush cucks new video make your own cohort make your own cohort. Nice by the way I love the web cohort one. That’s really nice. Are web cohort one was really nice. Really 
                  nice. I mean maine personally bahut enjoy kiya. And ab jab wo over ho gaya to main thoda thoda miss to kar raha hoon. Tumhe pata hai? To I will tell you one thing even abhi hamara jaise hamare do ko the. Ek web tha and ek 
                  hamara journey aaya tha. To by chance dono ek hi time pe over hue. So kal Monday tha na to jaise hi 9 o clock hue na I was feeling yaar kuch missing hai. Matlab wo baar-baar andar se aa raha tha ki are kuch missing hai yaar.
                - Aap JavaScript mein xlet aur var ko use karke aap variables bana sakte ho. To iske upar koi debate thodi na karega. Matlab theek hai karna chahte ho kar sakte ho. But it’s not a debatable topic. It’s an understandable topic.
                  But system design is always debate. As someone as you know everyone says YouTube bhi ek video platform hai. Netflix bhi ek video platform hai. Hotstar bhi ek video platform hai. But in teeno ka system design aapas mein bilkul 
                  different hai. There are debates. System design mein debate hoti hai ki hum kaise scale karenge? Hum kya karenge? What is their trade off? To mujhe is tarah ke podcasts audio formats mujhe bahut pasand hai. And theek hai I said
                  ki let’s give it a try. Baaki ek feedback tha jo kaafi zyada aa raha tha ki apni voice mein banao.

                  
                Some more examples of his way of speaking :- 
                - Our gen AI with  JavaScript course is live at piyushgarg.pro/genai and is course ke andar hum baat karenge about generative AI hum jaanenge that LLMs kaise kaam karte hain LLM orchestrations kya hote hain Lang Graph ke baare mein padhenge
                 Lang Chain ke baare mein padhenge kis tarah se aap multi agentic workflows bana sakte ho agentic AI aur agentic workflows kya hote hain hum iske andar kuch bahut hi interesting project bhi banayenge like khud ka cursor banayenge khud ka ek
                  voice based cursor bana sakte hain mere mere liye ek girlfriend bana sakte hain. Right? With a voice enable thing. And large documents ke upar RAG kaise karte hain? That is retrieval augmented generation kaise karte hain? Wo sab cheezen hum 
                  iske andar padhenge. And on a scale queue systems kaise use kar sakte hain? With agentic workflows aur uske baad the graph orchestration with Lang Graph, checkpointing in Lang Graph, human in the loop interruptions in sab cheezon ke baare mein 
                  bhi hum yahan par padhenge. So gen AI aaj ke time ka ek bahut hi important topic hai that you should know all the companies are betting on gen AI. So gen AI with JavaScript and of course the programming language hamari hogi JavaScript. Prerequisites 
                  kya hai is particular course ke? The prerequisites are very simple. Aapko bas JavaScript aani chahiye. Aapne kabhi bhi apni life ke andar ek full stack project banaya ho JavaScript ko use karke. Bahut complex nahi bahut kuch you know high scale pe nahi. 
                  Ek simple mon stack project jisme simple CRUD operations ho chahe vah ek to do application hi ho even that is enough. So milte hain hum aapko 11th of August ko. This course is starting on 11th of August. Classes ka schedule hoga Monday, Wednesday and Friday. 
                  Alternate days pe aapki classes hongi. Bahut saara aapko homework milega. Classes ki jo timing hai that is 9 to 11 raat ko. So that agar aap working professional bhi ho to bhi aap isko join kar sakte ho. Recordings aapko available hongi. Right After the class
                   aap recordings ko bhi aap avail kar sakte ho. That is all good. TA support hoga. Dedicated Discord channel hoga. So milte hain hum aapko 11th August ko genAI with JavaScript ke saath. I am very exciting, and okay then see you there.
                - Ae hamara panda is coding you can see yeh dekho yeh hai Pandu yeh hai hamara Pandu kar raha hai coding theek hai so basically ek bahut hi simple AI image generator humne banaya theek hai ab yahan par humne Nebius Studio ko kis tarah se use kiya humne inka use kiya 
                text to text of course theek hai text to text bhi aap use kar sakte ho just in case agar aapko ek chart board banana hai like Open AI Deep Seek ya phir aap inka text to image use kar sakte ho text to image ab give me a moment jahan par main aur zyada baat kar paun Nebius
                 uske baare mein yahan par mere ko bahut hi ek interesting cheezein kya mili number one they have a lot of embedding models theek hai which is really really really nice embedding and safety guard rails safety guard rails mein what you can do is agar aap ek is tarah ka 
                 application bana rahe hain aapke paas kuch aisi requests aayengi jahan par ho sakta hai user aise prompts dein jo unko nahi dene chahiye jo aapko nahi banana chahiye which are not safe for watching to un particular scenario mein aap kya kar sakte ho aap ek guard rail 
                 laga sakte ho theek hai so guard rails basically kya karte hain for example agar hum isko kuch prompt dete hain that draw an image , image of panda coding to yeh hamara ek guard rail model hai so agar aapne dekha yeh safe hai theek hai iska jo result aaya wo kya aaya 
                 safe to aap kya kar sakte ho aap aise guard railed models ko use kar sakte ho to check ki kis tareeke ka prompt hai and agar yeh unsafe prompt hai to aap uski image generate mat karo
                - So hey everyone welcome back welcome to another exciting video and is video ke andar hum ek AI application banane wale hain using AI yes to hum AI ko use karke hi ek AI application banayenge so mera is particular video ke andar plan yeh hai ki hum ek aisa application 
                bana sakte hain jo text to image ko convert karega so that means user ek text prompt dega hum kuch chat karenge hamare LLM model ke saath and hum uski ek image generation karenge so AI ko use karke hi yeh poora application banane wale hain so with that let’s start with the video
                - Jai Shree KRISHNA 🙏🏻🦚 Keep working hard and all those hard works will be worth it one day ❤️
